# Quiqr Desktop - Electron 29 edition

Finally we kicked off the porting of Quiqr to a recent Electron version. Because of old architecture we were kind of locked in version 9. This project will propably takes some time as we are implementing some other long lastig wishes as well. Here's a short change list:

- Port to update to Electron. At of writing v29
- Port to TypeScript (lift and shift)
- Multi Window Gui

All issues which will be fixed during this port are listed at https://github.com/quiqr/quiqr-desktop/labels/electron29

| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `@assets`     | `/assets`                  |
